# Lab 6  
I refactored project to make it MVP-like. Any printing action is replaced with a View class method. Simulaion class as a presenter calls methods of the view so the information could be output on the screen. Many other classes work partly as a model, containing main part of the data. Also config.properties contain the most important information. SOLID principles are respected: every class performs single action, classes are open for extension, but not modification, every parent could be substituted with its child, there is no need for implementing an unused interface, parents don't depend on their children.
